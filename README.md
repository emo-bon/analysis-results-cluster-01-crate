# analysis-results-cluster-01-data

This respository holds the EMBRC EMO BON MetaGoFlow analyses RO-Crates.
Once this repo has reached its maximum size limit, we will make a cluster-02 and so on.

***The repositories that will hold the MFG outputs are still under investigation, so while the data in here are all valid, they may be moved to another location and another organisation later***

More information is available in [data-workflow-book](https://data.emobon.embrc.eu/data-workflow-book/).
